# EDA-prjct
Data analysis using python project

To run the Jupyter Notebook file containing the code for this analysis, simply download the ipynb file and open it in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle. You can find the dataset here : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running/discussion/420633

## Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which provides insights into ultra-marathon running. The analysis aims to uncover patterns, trends, and valuable information hidden in the data.
